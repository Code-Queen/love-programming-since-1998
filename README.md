# love-programming-since-1998
A collection of C++, C files that I have coded in 1998. Left for memories, with love :) &lt;3

Long a ago.. my programming journey started when I was 8-9 years old.

These code hasn't been changed since 1998, for memories.

Living in a village with very limited Internet and computers, we were very lucky to have private courses once a week for programming with c++, c, pascal, basic since it was a village of scientists. And, of course, I went to these courses! That was me and one or two guys students and a teacher among entire school, who were passionate about programming. Every lesson, the teacher introduced us to some concepts of the language, and we had to solve a problem on our own with no books and Internet during our class. I loved not only develop a solution, but also help find bugs in other's code.

What I loved the most, is to be able to think in the logic that computer thinks.

I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to attend these classes.
